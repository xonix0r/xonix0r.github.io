    <h1>1. The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R Tolkien
        
        </h2>
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566425108i/33.jpg" alt="LOTR" style="width: 300px;"/>
    <p class="small-text">Just to clarify, this list is not in order from favorite to least favorite.
        The Lord of the Rings is the only book Ive read in my entire for the sake of entertainment without the purpose
        of learning something from it. I first read it when i was 14 when I just plopped myself in a corner and would go at it for a few hours
        or I would read it before bed as well. Despite me reading it without the intention of learning I actually learnt a lot including how 
        how in order to be where you want to be in the future you must sacrifice. Sacrifice your bad habits and regular leisure. Understand the struggle
        between good and evil despite being tempted to persue corrupt power. I dont like being controversial, but we can see this through countless politicians who accept
        bribes from foreign governments to push certain agendas (Not specifying who this is just a common occurence throughout history).

    <h1>2. The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene</h3>

    <p class="small-text">
        Reading this at such a young age (13-14) resulted in me being extremely observant even on the smallest things
        this is a must read and I dont say this lightly. It made me feel as if I was always steps ahead compared to everyone around me
        because obviously no young teen is concerned about how people may attempt to exploit them but lets hope kids that age dont have the
        intention to do that anyways. What happened was that I entered a state of solitude and understood how quite literally everything could make me weaker
        media, food, music, you name it. I eventually stopped talking to everyone except 1-2 people because they actually served a purpose in my life.
        Also to clarify I am currently 16 years old.

    <h1>3. Hard Times Create Strong Men by Stefan Aarnio</h3>

    <p class="small-text">

        What can I even say. Extremely controversial thats for sure. Almost a bible for masculinity.
        How to not be a weak person with a weak mindset and how to have the most BASED political opinions. I read this recently at
        the age of 16.

    <h1>4. The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon</h4>
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352548717i/377965.jpg" alt="HDFRM" style="width: 300px;"/>
    <p class="small-text">
        The picture shows volume 1, however I read the abridged edition which is all
        the volumes put together and summarized. People usually focus on how empires rise to 
        power and how they can learn from that. Thats good, but what is better is to reflect on 
        how these mighty empires get crumbled and thrown into the trashbin of history. Many usually rise in 
        their own unique ways, however if you look at how they all fall it is almost identical.Economic challenges, 
        nationalist movements/uprisings, Invasions from outsiders, and the list goes on.

    <h1>5. The Way of the Superior Man by David Deida</h5>
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1677511391i/123022371.jpg" alt="WSM" style="width: 300px;"/>
    <p class="small-text">
        This book is powerful and there is a lot to learn from it. It taught me at a young age how to properly respect women.
    </p>
    <h1>6. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</h5>
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421618636i/30659.jpg" alt="WSM" style="width: 300px;"/>
    <p class="small-text">
        Why would you not read this? Imagine if a man who ruled the mightiest empire gave you
        an unbiased handbook on how to be a masculine and stoic man, would you turn it down? 
        I learnt countless of valuable things and you will too.
    </p>
    <h1>7. Zero to One by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters</h5>
        <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630663027i/18050143.jpg" alt="WSM" style="width: 300px;"/>
        <p class="small-text">
            This book is amazing. Same case scenario with meditations. A billionaire yes billion with a b, gives you a book.
            Why would you ever turn it down? This book taught me how to go from an average consumer to a creator, or synthesizer 
            even. going from zero to one instead of from 1 to n.
